I decided to call this game "space impact".
So basically, the mechanics are you have to shoot the asteroids and avoid the missiles. You can use the left and right arow to move the spaceship. The up arrow will allow you to shoot. In LEVEL 1, there will be only 1 enemy, til you reach 15 asteroids, which will direct you to LEVEL 2, then a bomb will appear in which you have to avoid as well. If you reach 30 asteroids, you will move up another level. Here you don't have to shoot any asteroids or avoid missiles, but instead, you need to avoid 3 space monsters, moving in different directions. If you pass through 3, you win. 

You lose if asteroids touch the bottom, if missiles hit you and if the space monsters hit you.
